	<h2>A LOT About Me.</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>It has been  years since I developed a deep love for learning, I was a psychology major at Marymount California University before I choose to leave.
	After that I pursued a successful career path in Commercial Real Estate but keep finding myself reading journals such as Nature which have great articles on
	Computer Science and Neurobiology. I also found myself spending most of my free time reading peer reviewed Journals and articles on Machine Learning, 
	Natural Language Processing, and the use of Computers for improving Brain Technology.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>That is when I finally gave in and started to learn about programming.  I joined the Association for Computing Machinery. Which lead to reading their monthly publications, 
		which opened my mind to the vast world of Computer Science and its sub-fields.  Since then I have been learning to program online using sites such as: 
		Coursera, Khan Academy, and Udemy.</p>
	<p>After quite a bit of research and reading I took my first course online CS 101 an Introduction to Computer Science offered by Stanford. 
		After that I completed a class in R programming offered by John Hopkins University through Courseraâ€™s Certificate Program.
		SO WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID.... That is why I'm in this cohort today and look forward to learning more, becoming a proficient programmer
		and continuing to pursue my goals; Which are, completing a degree in CS while obtaining real world experience by acquiring a job in QA upon completion of this cohort.</p>
