	<h2>A Little Bit About Me.</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>It has been many years since I developed a deep love for learning, I was a psychology major at Marymount California University before I choose to leave.  
	After that I pursuied a sucessful career path in Commmercial Real Estate but keep finding myself reading journal such as Nature which have great articles on computer science and nuerobiology. 
	I also found myself spending almost all my free time reading peer reviewed Journals and articles on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and the use of Computers for improving Brain Technology.
	That is when I finally gave in and took the deep dive and started to learn to program.  I joined the Association for Computing Machinery where I began reading their monthly publications, which opened 
	my mind to the vast world of Computer Science and its sub-feilds.  Since then I have been learning to program online using sites such as: Coursera, Khan Academy, and Udemy. After quite a bit of research and reading I took my first course online
	which was CS 101 an Introduction to Computer Science offered by Stanford online. After that I completed a class in R programming offered by John Hopkins University through Coursera's Certificate Progam.  
	SO WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID.... That is why I'm in this cohort today and look forward to continuing to accomplishing my goals; Which are, completing a degree in CS while obtaining real world experience by aquiring a job in QA upon completion of this cohort.</p>
